# 2.2. Create an Optimized Dataset

![Data Lake Architecture](/images/modules/transform.png?width=50pc)


> {{%expand "Transform Data using Apache Spark & AWS Glue Development Endpoints" %}}
After running test SQL queries in Amazon Athena, you verify that you can make the following improvements to the NYC Taxi trips dataset. Ultimately, these improvements together reduce per-query Amazon Athena cost and improve Unicorn-Taxi's Business Users' eXperience.

- **Convert the Dataset from CSV** to a compressed and splittable columnar file format, such as **Parquet**. This enables Amazon Athena to optimize query execution by avoiding scanning columns that are not needed by your query and rows that are filtered out by your query.
- **Partition the Dataset** in Amazon S3 by year and month into Hive-style partitions. The Partitioning Scheme enables queries that filter on a specific Year or Month to avoid scanning unnecessary data for other Years and Months, thereby acting as a crude index.
- **De-normalize the Dataset** by joining the primary fact table **_yellow_** with the dimension tables **_taxizone_** , **_ratecode_** , and **_paymenttype_**. This creates a new table that is simpler to query and run reports on.
- **Create new columns and drop unnecessary columns**.

To develop and test code to apply such transformations on the large NYC Taxi trips dataset, you consider using an **Apache Spark** environment that can access and manipulate your data directly in Amazon S3. You decide to take advantage of **AWS Glue Development Endpoints** for that purpose. Also, instead of setting up and managing your own Zeppelin or Jupyter Notebook Server, you leverage AWS Glue's ability to launch a fully-managed Jupyter Notebook Instance for interactive ETL and Machine Learning development. Your Jupyter Notebook will use your AWS Glue Development Endpoint to run your ETL code written in **PySpark** or **Scala**.

Let's go through the steps to setup your interactive ETL Notebook Environment and apply the Data Transformations.

The AWS Glue Dev Endpoint was automatically created for you by the AWS CloudFormation template your ran in section "1.2.1. Get your AWS account ready".

1. Navigate to the [AWS Glue console](https://ap-southeast-1.console.aws.amazon.com/glue/home?region=ap-southeast-1)
2. In the left menu, under **ETL**, click **Dev endpoints**
3. Verify there is a dev endpoint named **nyctaxi-dev-endpoint-**
4. Verify that the status is **READY**

### 2.3.1. Create an Amazon SageMaker Notebook instance

Proceed to create a SageMaker Notebook instance. Follow these steps.

1. In the left menu, under [**ETL** → **Dev endpoints** , click **Notebooks**](https://ap-southeast-1.console.aws.amazon.com/glue/home?region=ap-southeast-1#etl:tab=notebooks)
2. Click **Create notebook**
3. For **Notebook name**, enter `nyctaxi-notebook`
4. For **Attach to development endpoint**, select `nyctaxi-dev-endpoint-`
5. Select **Choose an existing IAM role** then choose
    `AWSGlueServiceSageMakerNotebookRole-nyctaxi_`
6. Click **Create notebook**. This will take you back to the **Notebooks** page.
7. Click the **Refresh** button, if needed. You should notice a notebook with the name **`aws-glue-nyctaxi-notebook`** and the status **Starting**.

> ✍️ The Amazon SageMaker notebook should take **about 6 minutes** to transfer into a **Ready** status.


### 2.3.2. Interactively author and run ETL code in Jupyter

> 🎯 First, We'll download the ETL Notebook we prepared for you; then upload the Notebook to your own Amazon SageMaker Notebook, from the AWS Glue console.

1. Download Notebook file **[nyctaxi_raw_dataset_etl.ipynb](https://github.com/nnthanh101/serverless-data-lake/blob/nyc-taxi/README/nyc-taxi/nyctaxi_raw_dataset_etl.ipynb)**
2. Navigate to the [**AWS Glue** console](https://ap-southeast-1.console.aws.amazon.com/glue/home?region=ap-southeast-1#etl:tab=notebooks).  In the left menu, under **ETL** → **Dev endpoints**, click **Notebooks**
4. Select **aws-glue-nyctaxi-notebook**, then click **Open notebook** and then **OK**. A new browser tab will open showing **Jupyter** interface
5. In **Jupyter**, in the upper right corner, click the **Upload** button
6. Browse to and select `nyctaxi_raw_dataset_etl.ipynb`, then in Jupyter, click **Upload** again. After upload, the Notebook should appear in Jupyter.
7. Click on **nyctaxi_raw_dataset_etl.ipynb** to open Notebook. Spend a few moments to have an overview of the documented ETL Code and what it does.

> 🎯Next, We'll edit the **ETL code** in the Notebook and then run it on the Raw NYC Taxi Trips Dataset.

1. In **Jupyter**, ensure the `nyctaxi_raw_dataset_etl.ipynb` notebook is open
2. In the **first PySpark code cell**, look for the variable ~~**your-datalake-bucket**~~. Set the value of that string variable to **your own Amazon S3 bucket’s name** ~~`serverless-data-lake-XXX`~~
3. Click the **Save and Checkpoint** button to save the change you made to your notebook.
4. Click on the **Cells** menu → **Run All**
5. This will run *ETL code* in the Notebook. The code finally creates a new dataset under the Amazon S3 prefix in your own account:
    ```
    s3://serverless-data-lake-XXX/data/staging/nyctaxi/yellow_opt/
    ```
    Note: replace ~~`serverless-data-lake-XXX`~~ with your actual bucket's name.

> ✍️The Notebook should take about 8 minutes to complete.
